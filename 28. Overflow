Overflow:

This overflow property specifies what should happen if content overflows an element's box. 
This property specifies whether to clip content or to add scrollbars when an element's content is too big to fit in a specified area.
By default, overflow:visible, which means the content is seen if it exceeds the specified height or width.
So we can use overflow : hidden for the content which exceeds the mentioned height and width.


visible	          This overflow is not clipped. It renders outside the element's box. This is default.
auto	            This overflow is clipped, a scroll-bar should be added to see the rest of the content.
scroll	          This overflow is clipped, but a scroll-bar is added to see the rest of the content.
overflow	        This specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.
overflow-wrap	    This specifies whether or not the browser can break lines with long words, if they overflow its container.
overflow-x	      This specifies what to do with the left/right edges of the content if it overflows the element's content area.
overflow-y	      This specifies what to do with the top/bottom edges of the content if it overflows the element's content area.
