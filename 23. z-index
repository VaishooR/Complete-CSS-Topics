z-index:
This z-index is a CSS property that defines the order of overlapping HTML elements. 
Elements with a higher index will be placed on top of elements with a lower index.


z-index: 1;                /* It decides which element will show on top of the other. 
                              The first to show, is the one with the greatest index   */
                  
                  
                  
/******************* NOTES ABOUT THE Z-INDEX **********************/
/* By default, the z-index of an element is zero, so if you change the 
z-index to something above or below that value, you are putting that 
element above or below the ones you didn't change.
Another important thing to be aware of is that the z-index only works 
for elements that have a position different from the standard. This 
means that, for elements with Static position, this won't work.
So, you can only make two elements interact in the z plane if they both 
have a define position as: Relative, Absolute, Fixed, ... */

tag_name_1 {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: -1; 
}
tag_name_2 {
  position: relative;      /* tag_name_1 will be below the tag_name_2 */
}

<style>
.box{
    background-color:pink;
    color:white;
    width:500px;

    position:absolute;
}
.box1{
    background-color:teal;
    top:50px;
    left:100px;
    z-index:3;                               //here 3 is the greatest z-index num. So this box appears on the top over the other two boxes.
}
.box2{
    background-color:tomato;
    top:100px;
    left:150px;
    z-index:2;
}
.box3{
    background-color:yellowgreen;
    top:150px;
    left:200px;
    z-index:1;                               //here 1 is the lowest z-index num. So this box appears at the last behind the other two boxes.
}
