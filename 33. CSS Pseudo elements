Pseudo elements:

This pseudo-element can be defined as a keyword which is combined to a selector that defines the special state of the selected elements. 
Unlike the pseudo-classes, 
pseudo-elements are used to style the specific part of an element, whereas 
pseudo-classes are used to style the element.

Some pseudo-elements are:
  ::before
  ::after
  ::first-letter
  ::first-line
  ::selection
  ::placeholder
  
  
  
  ::selection applies a style to the text, when selected. bg-color and text-color are changed on selection.
  ::placeholder applies styles to texts present in input textbox.
  ::first-letter selects 1st alphabet in the 1st line of the selected element and applies style to it.
  ::first-line selects 1st line of the selected element and applies style to it.
