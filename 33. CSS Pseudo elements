Pseudo elements:

This pseudo-element can be defined as a keyword which is combined to a selector that defines the special state of the selected elements. 
Unlike the pseudo-classes, 
pseudo-elements are used to style the specific part of an element, whereas 
pseudo-classes are used to style the element.

Some pseudo-elements are:
  ::before
  ::after
  ::first-letter
  ::first-line
  ::selection
  ::placeholder
  
  -----------------------------
  
  ::selection applies a style to the text, when selected. bg-color and text-color are changed on selection.
  ::placeholder applies styles to texts present in input textbox.
  ::first-letter selects 1st alphabet in the 1st line of the selected element and applies style to it.
  ::first-line selects 1st line of the selected element and applies style to it.
  
  ::after &  ::before
  The ::after selector inserts something after the content of each selected element(s).
  Use the ::before selector to insert something before the content.
  Use the content property to specify the content to insert.
  
  Example:
  <style>
  p::after { 
    content: " - Remember this";
    background-color: yellow;
    color: red;
    font-weight: bold;
  }
  p::before{
    content:'Sentence  - ';
    text-transform:uppercase;
    color:blue;
  }
  </style>
  
  <p>My name is Donald</p>
  <p>I live in Ducksburg</p>
  
  
  Output:
  Sentence  - My name is Donald  - Remember this
  Sentence  - I live in Ducksburg  - Remember this
