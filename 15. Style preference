What is Specificity?

If there are two or more CSS rules that point to the same element, 
the selector with the highest specificity value will "win", 
and its style declaration will be applied to that HTML element.




---------------------------------------------------------
--> id selector is given the 1st preference.
--> class selector has the 2nd preference.
--> element selector is given the 3rd preference.
--> But !important has the highest priority among all of them.
----------------------------------------------------------




----------------------------------------------------------
--> inline css overrides css rules in style tag(internal css) and css file(external css).
--> A more specific selector takes precedence over a less specific one.
--> Rules that appear later in the code override earlier rules if both have the same specificity.
--> A css rule with !important always takes precedence.
