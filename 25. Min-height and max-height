By default, the height property is set to auto, height:auto, i.e it expands according to its contents height.

min-height: 
min-height is the minimum height set to the content even if the content is lesser than the specifeid min-height value.
But as the content increases the min-height value it starts expanding according to the content height.
But when content size is decreased, the height also gets shrinked but only till the min-height value. It stops at the min-height value even if the content has extra space.

max-height:
max-height is the maximum value set for the height to expand. After this value, the max-height stops expanding and the content starts overflowing.

Example:
div{
      border:5px solid red;
      padding: 10px;
      min-height: 200px;
      max-height: 500px;
   }
  
Here, this means that no matter what the content height is, the height is fixed to min 200px and max 500px.
Which means, the content exceeding the max-height value is going to overflow, and the content less than the min-height is going to have empty space between the border and the content.

max-height
The max-height property in CSS is used to set the maximum height of an element. 
If the content of the element is larger than the specified maximum-height then the content will overflow otherwise it has no effect. 
If the content of the element is smaller then it has no effect. This property value can be overridden by the max-height property.

min-height
The min-height property in CSS is used to set the minimum height of an element. 
This is used when the content of element is smaller than the min-height and if the content is larger than the min-height then it has no effect. 
This property ensures that the value of the height property is not less than the specified min-height value of the element in consideration.
