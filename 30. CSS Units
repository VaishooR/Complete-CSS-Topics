The CSS has several different units for expressing a length. This many CSS properties take "length" values, such as width, margin, padding, font-size, etc.

  Absolute Units: Based on screen size.
    cm  Centimeters
    mm  Millimeters
    in  Inches
    px  pixels
    pt  Points
    pc  Picas

  Relative Units: Based on parent element size.
    em
    rem    relative em
    vw     viewport width
    vh     viewport height
    vmax   viewport maximum
    vmin   viewport minimum
    %      percentage
    ch

  Commonly used units:
    px - This define the measurement in points.
         pixel is an absolute unit. i.e when screen size is changed, the pixel value doesnot change according to the screen size. Remains constant.
    
    %  - This used to define the measurement as a percentage that is relative to another value, To the parent value.
    
    em - Works based on direct parent element's size.
         if not mentioned, then it works based on the browser base value.
         If parent element is not mentioned with any size, then it takes its base size as browsers font size.
         1 em = 16 px.
         It is a relative unit. Works based on browsers base vale. Browser base value can be small medium large etc. By default it is medium.
         2 em = 2 * browser base value
         Now if parent element size is mentioned as font-size:5px;
         Then the em value is changed according tp its parent element value.
         i.e font-size: 2 em means 2*5px=10px
         
    rem - Works based on root parent element's size. i.e html
          if html{font-size:10px} is mentioned, then rem works based on this value.
          if not mentioned, then it works based on the browser base value.
          
    vw - width of the device not the browser
    vh - height of the device not the browser
    vmax - relative to the smaller dimension of the viewport.
    vmin - relative to the larger dimension of the viewport.
